Need help with Sound Levels? You're in the right place.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate is Sound Levels?

Sound Levels provides approximate readings using your device's built-in microphone. While useful for general awareness and comparison, phone microphones are not calibrated instruments. For precise measurements requiring legal or professional accuracy, use certified equipment.

### Why does the app need microphone access?

The microphone is used solely to measure ambient sound levels in real-time. **No audio is recorded or stored.** All processing happens on your device, and sound data is immediately discarded after measurement.

### How do I change measurement modes?

Tap any of the mode buttons at the top of the screen:
- **General** - Everyday sound level monitoring
- **Workplace** - Office and industrial environment awareness
- **Nursery** - Baby room monitoring with gentle alerts
- **Music** - Concert and practice session levels

### How do I remove ads?

Tap the "Upgrade" button in the app to purchase the ad-free version. This is a one-time purchase that removes all banner ads permanently.

### The app shows "Audio Not Available"

This message appears when:
- Running on the iOS Simulator (use a physical device)
- Microphone permission was denied (check Settings > Sound Levels > Microphone)

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start measuring

1. Ensure microphone permission is granted in Settings
2. Tap the play button to start measurement
3. If issues persist, try closing and reopening the app

### Readings seem inaccurate

- Ensure nothing is blocking your device's microphone
- Background noise or wind can affect readings
- Phone cases may muffle the microphone
