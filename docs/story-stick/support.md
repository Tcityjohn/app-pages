## Frequently Asked Questions

### Voice Input

**Q: The app isn't hearing me correctly. What can I do?**

A: Make sure you're in a reasonably quiet environment. Speak clearly and at a natural pace. If the app misunderstands a number, try saying it differently — for example, "twenty" instead of "two zero." You can also try rephrasing: "studs for a 20 foot wall" works as well as "how many studs for a 20 foot wall."

**Q: Can I use the app without voice?**

A: Story Stick is designed as a voice-first tool for hands-busy job site use. Voice input is the primary way to interact with the app.

**Q: What language does the app support?**

A: Story Stick currently supports English. It understands common trade terminology and measurement shorthand used by contractors in the US.

### Formulas & Calculations

**Q: What trades does Story Stick support?**

A: Story Stick includes 155+ formulas across framing, concrete, roofing, tile, cabinetry, carpet, plumbing, electrical, masonry, painting, drywall, and more. Select your trade in Settings to see formulas prioritized for your work.

**Q: The answer doesn't look right. What should I check?**

A: Tap "Show the Math" on any answer to see the formula and step-by-step calculation. This lets you verify the inputs were heard correctly. If a number was misheard, try asking again with clearer phrasing.

**Q: Why does the app show fractions instead of decimals?**

A: Story Stick is built for tradespeople who read tape measures. Fractions (like 3-1/2") are what you see on the tape, so that's what we give you. You can adjust fraction precision (1/8", 1/16") in Settings.

### Widgets

**Q: How do I add the lock screen widget?**

A: Long-press on your lock screen, tap "Customize," then tap "Add Widgets." Find Story Stick in the list and add it. Tap the widget to open the app ready to listen.

**Q: The widget shows blank. What's wrong?**

A: Make sure you're running iOS 17 or later. Try removing and re-adding the widget. If the issue persists, try restarting your device.

### Settings

**Q: How do I change my trade?**

A: Open the app, tap the gear icon (Settings), then tap "Trade" to select your primary trade. This changes which formulas appear first in the formula guide.

**Q: Can I switch between imperial and metric?**

A: Yes. Go to Settings and change your preferred unit system. Story Stick will format answers accordingly.
