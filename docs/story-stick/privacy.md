# Story Stick Privacy Policy

Last Updated: February 11, 2026

## Overview

Story Stick is a mobile application that helps contractors and tradespeople solve trade math using voice input, with answers formatted in fractions for tape measure readability. This privacy policy explains how our app handles data and respects your privacy.

## Voice Input

- The app uses your device's microphone only when you actively trigger voice input
- Speech is converted to text on-device using iOS speech recognition
- Voice data is processed in real-time and immediately discarded after conversion
- We never have access to your actual voice recordings

## Data Collection

**All data stays on your device.** We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any server.

### Microphone

- Used only when you tap the microphone button to ask a question
- Audio is processed on-device by Apple's Speech Recognition framework
- No audio data is stored or transmitted

### Speech Recognition

- Converts your spoken words to text on-device
- Text is used locally to match trade formulas and calculate answers
- No transcription data leaves your device

## Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device:

- **Calculation history** — stored in local device storage (Hive)
- **Trade preference** — stored in device preferences
- **Unit settings** — stored in device preferences
- **No cloud sync, no accounts, no server communication**

Uninstalling the app removes all stored data.
