## Frequently Asked Questions

### Creating Workouts

**Q: How do I create a workout?**

A: Tap the microphone button or type in the text field on the Create screen. Describe your workout naturally, like "4 rounds of push-ups, squats, and burpees, 30 seconds on, 15 seconds rest." The AI will parse it into a timed workout.

**Q: My voice input isn't working. What should I do?**

A: Make sure you've granted microphone and speech recognition permissions. Go to iOS Settings > AI Workout Timer and check that both Microphone and Speech Recognition are enabled.

**Q: Can I edit a workout after it's created?**

A: Yes! After the AI parses your workout, you'll see a preview where you can adjust exercises, durations, and rest periods before starting.

### Voice Coaching

**Q: How do I change the coach voice?**

A: Go to Settings and select a different coach persona. Each coach (Ace, Guardian, Lass, Samurai, Siren) has a unique voice and coaching style.

**Q: The voice quality doesn't sound great. Can I improve it?**

A: AI Workout Timer uses Apple's on-device premium voices. For the best experience, download premium voices in iOS Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices. The app's Voice Setup Guide will walk you through this.

**Q: Can I use the app without voice coaching?**

A: Yes. If voice coaching is unavailable, the app automatically falls back to beep sounds to keep your workout rhythm.

### During Workouts

**Q: Can I lock my screen during a workout?**

A: Yes! Voice coaching and beeps continue playing when the screen is locked, so you can focus on your workout.

**Q: How does the timer work?**

A: The timer follows a WORK > REST cycle for each exercise. You'll hear voice cues for exercise changes, halfway marks, countdown warnings, and motivational pushes.

### Subscriptions & Purchases

**Q: How do I restore my purchase?**

A: Go to Settings in the app and tap "Restore Purchases." Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID you used for the original purchase.

**Q: How do I cancel my subscription?**

A: Subscriptions are managed through your Apple ID:
1. Open the Settings app on your iPhone
2. Tap your name at the top
3. Tap Subscriptions
4. Find AI Workout Timer and tap Cancel

**Q: What's included in the free trial?**

A: During the 14-day free trial, you get full access to all features including unlimited workout creation and all five coach personas.
