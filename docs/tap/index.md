# TAP

### Stop fighting about screen time. Start agreeing.

TAP helps families negotiate screen time rules together. Instead of spying on your teen or blocking their apps, TAP creates a two-way agreement where everyone has a voice.

---

## How TAP Works

**1. Create a Pact Together**
Parents and teens sit down and build a screen time agreement with clear responsibilities and benefits. Both sides agree before a pact goes live.

**2. Check In Daily**
Teens check in each day with a photo showing they completed their part. No surveillance, no tracking — just honest accountability built on trust.

**3. Build Streaks & Earn Rewards**
Watch completion streaks grow as your family builds consistent habits. Parents can send rewards like extra screen time to recognize great effort.

## Why TAP is Different

Most screen time apps treat teens as the problem. They spy, block, and restrict. Teens resist, find workarounds, and resent the surveillance.

TAP reframes screen time as a **family agreement** where everyone has a voice:

- **Teens feel respected** — they help write the rules and can propose changes when things aren't working
- **Parents get accountability** — daily photo check-ins provide proof without surveillance
- **Families build trust** — streaks and rewards celebrate consistency, not compliance

## Built for Families with Teens

TAP is designed for that tricky age where kids need both freedom and structure. It teaches real negotiation skills — a life skill that extends way beyond screen time.

## Privacy First

TAP collects only what's needed to make the app work. No location tracking. No browsing history. No selling data.
