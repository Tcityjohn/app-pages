## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I create a family group?**

A: Sign up as a parent, then tap "Create Family" during setup. You'll get a unique invite code to share with your family members.

**Q: How does my teen join our family?**

A: Your teen signs up for their own account and enters your family's invite code when prompted. You can find and share the code from Settings.

**Q: What's the difference between parent and teen accounts?**

A: Parents create pacts (screen time agreements), review check-ins, and send rewards. Teens check in daily with proof of completed tasks and can propose changes to pacts through renegotiation.

### Pacts & Check-ins

**Q: How do pacts work?**

A: A pact is an agreement between parent and teen about screen time responsibilities. Parents set the terms (responsibilities and benefits), and teens check in daily to show they've completed their tasks.

**Q: How do check-ins work?**

A: Teens tap "Check In Now" on the home screen, select which responsibility they completed, and take a photo as proof. Parents review and approve the check-in.

**Q: What happens if a check-in is not approved?**

A: Parents can request a redo with a note explaining what's needed. The teen can then submit a new check-in for that task.

### Streaks & Rewards

**Q: How do streaks work?**

A: Streaks count consecutive days of completing all pact check-ins. The longer the streak, the better! Streaks reset if a day is missed.

**Q: What are rewards?**

A: Parents can send rewards (like extra screen time or custom rewards) to recognize consistent pact compliance. Rewards appear as notifications for the teen.

### Account & Privacy

**Q: How do I delete my account?**

A: Go to Settings and tap "Delete Account" at the bottom. This permanently removes your account and all associated data. This action cannot be undone.

**Q: Is my teen's data safe?**

A: Yes. Check-in photos and pact data are only visible to members of your family group. We don't sell data or serve ads. See our [Privacy Policy](./privacy) for full details.
