# Voice Crumbs Privacy Policy

Last Updated: February 7, 2026

## Overview

Voice Crumbs is a mobile application that captures voice journal entries, transcribes them on-device, and stores them with end-to-end encryption. This privacy policy explains how our app handles data and respects your privacy.

## Voice Input

- The app uses your device's microphone only when you actively trigger voice input
- Speech is converted to text on-device using iOS speech recognition
- Voice data is processed in real-time and immediately discarded after conversion
- We never have access to your actual voice recordings

## Data Collection

**All journal entries stay on your device.** We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal journal data to our servers. Your entries are encrypted with AES-256 encryption and stored locally.

### Microphone & Speech Recognition

- Used only during active voice recording (press-and-hold interaction)
- Audio is processed on-device by iOS speech recognition
- No voice data is stored, transmitted, or accessible to us

### Notifications

- Used for weekly digest reminders and entry resurfacing
- All notifications are local — no push notification server involved
- You can disable notifications in iOS Settings or within the app

## Analytics (PostHog)

We use PostHog to understand how users interact with the app:

- We collect anonymous usage data (screens visited, features used)
- We do not collect personal information or voice data
- Journal entry content is never included in analytics
- Analytics help us improve the app experience
- You can opt out of analytics in your device settings

## In-App Purchases (RevenueCat)

We use RevenueCat to process subscription and one-time purchase transactions:

- Only transaction data necessary for purchase processing is collected
- No personal financial information is stored within the app
- Purchase history is managed through your Apple ID

## Data Storage

All journal entries are encrypted with AES-256 encryption on your device. The encryption key is stored in the iOS Keychain and never leaves your device. We have no way to read your entries — even if your device data were somehow accessed, the entries would be unreadable without the key.

Unencrypted data stored locally includes only app preferences (writing style, notification settings, onboarding status). These contain no personal or journal content.

| Service | Purpose | Data Collected |
