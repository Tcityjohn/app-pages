## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I create a voice entry?**

A: On the Today screen, press and hold the sphere in the center. Speak your thought naturally. When you release, your speech is transcribed and saved automatically.

**Q: How does category detection work?**

A: Voice Crumbs listens for natural cues in your speech. Starting with "I think..." creates a Thought. "I remember..." creates a Memory. "What if..." or "I have an idea..." creates an Idea. You can also just speak freely and it will be categorized as an Observation.

**Q: Are my entries private?**

A: Yes. All entries are encrypted with AES-256 encryption and stored only on your device. We cannot read your entries. There is no cloud sync or server storage.

### Voice Recognition

**Q: The app isn't transcribing my speech correctly.**

A: Voice Crumbs uses your device's built-in speech recognition. For best results: speak clearly, minimize background noise, and ensure you have a stable connection (some devices use on-device recognition, others may use Apple's servers for initial setup).

**Q: Can I use Voice Crumbs without voice input?**

A: The app is designed around voice input. Text entry may be available but voice is the primary interaction method.

### Entries & Data

**Q: Where are my entries stored?**

A: Encrypted on your device only. They are never uploaded to any server.

**Q: What happens if I delete the app?**

A: All entries will be permanently deleted. Since entries are stored only on your device with no cloud backup, uninstalling the app removes all data. This cannot be undone.

**Q: Can I export my entries?**

A: Export functionality is not currently available. Your entries are encrypted on-device for maximum privacy.

### Weekly Digest

**Q: What is the weekly digest?**

A: Every Sunday at 7 PM, Voice Crumbs sends a local notification with a summary of your week's entries. It's a way to reflect on what you captured.

**Q: How do I turn off digest notifications?**

A: Go to Settings within the app and toggle Weekly Digest off. You can also disable notifications in iOS Settings.

### Subscriptions & Purchases

**Q: How do I restore my purchase?**

A: Go to Settings in the app and tap "Restore Purchases." Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID you used for the original purchase.

**Q: How do I cancel my subscription?**

A: Subscriptions are managed through your Apple ID:
1. Open the Settings app on your iPhone
2. Tap your name at the top
3. Tap Subscriptions
4. Find Voice Crumbs and tap Cancel

**Q: What's included in the free version?**

A: You get a 14-day free trial with unlimited access. After the trial, you can create up to 3 voice entries per week for free.
